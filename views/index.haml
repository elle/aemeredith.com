  %p
    Lately, people have been asking me what are the things I look for at a workplace.
    Different people value different things.
    For example, some would like to work on a product that will make a difference.
    Others would like to work where at diverse workplaces or with other parents where there are good family benefits.
    Some want parts of each of those, and more. Here are mine:

  %ul
    %li Work with friends (so work is not just a job)
    %li
      Write clean code accompanied with tests
      (so there is not a constant pressure to push out features without any regard to the quality of the code)
    %li Has a learning and self-growth culture (preferably with people I can learn from)
    %li Has good work etiquette and respect for peers (code reviews is a great place to check that)
    %li Maintain work-life balance (so there is no expectation to work late)
    %li Flexible with remote work
    %li Allow for autonomy and agency
    %li Good pay

  %p
    I can work without some of these things, but I typically choose not to.

  %p
    Whatever you value, whether it is working on new languages or an exciting project,
    I hope you define for yourself what makes you happy and productive at work.
